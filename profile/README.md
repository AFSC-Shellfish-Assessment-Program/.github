# Our general goals for this shared environment:

-Support everyone in the shellfish program to make their data analysis better and easier

-Be a welcoming place for all in the program, regardless of their current skill set

# More specific objectives for the program around data processing and analysis:

-Move towards a standard of conducting all data processing in script

-Move towards a standard of sharing all data sets in version-controlled, documented repositories

-Move towards a shared language for data processing and analysis (R)

-Allow the sharing of scripts for standardized tasks such as survey data querying and processing

-Make data analysis public within the program and/or for the larger public to aid reproducibility
